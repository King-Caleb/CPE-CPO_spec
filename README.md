# CPE-CPO_spec

This repository contains the specification for the CPE/CPO format I designed for an OS project.

Implement the spec and fork this repo so your name appears on OS boot.

The OS is called **CalamOS**, and you will be implementing the **Coslaw Build Toolchain (CBT)**:  
- The **assembler** is **CASM**  
- The **linker** can be any name you choose

---

## Rules of Implementation

1. Avoid C (or use very sparingly). C is prone to memory leaks, out-of-bounds reads, and runtime errors.  
2. Implementation must be in **Vox** or **C++**. Compilers for both are available and suitable for CASM.  
3. Follow the **CPO spec** at least loosely, **but CASM syntax and the CPE format must be implemented exactly 1:1**.  
4. If you are working on this, email **Calamu.king@outlook.com** with your code attached for more details or once your implementation is complete.
