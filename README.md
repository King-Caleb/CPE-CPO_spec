# CPE-CPO_spec
The spec for the CPE/CPO format I made for an OS project. Implement the spec and fork the repo for your name to be shown on OS boot.
And the OS is called CalamOS so you will be implementing the Coslaw Build Toolchain's (CBT) assembler and linker. The assembler is CASM, the linkr can be any name you choose.

**Rules of implementation**
1. Little or no C. C is unsafe with memory leaks, out of bounds read and large amounts of runtime errors
2. It must be in Vox or C++. Vox and C++ compilers are available already and so makes it a good choice for implementing CASM.
3. You must follow the CPO spec at lest loosely BUT the CASM syntax and CPE format MUST be followed 1 to 1
4. If you are working on this, email Calamu.king@outlook.com with your code attached for more detsils or if you are done.
